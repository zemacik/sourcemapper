# SourceMapper 
Can analyze a sourcemap generated by tools like webpack, and produce the original JavaScript files. It achieves this by reconstructing the source tree using the file paths provided in the sourcemap.

The Sourcemapper project draws inspiration from Denis Andzakovic's Sourcemaps project, which is also implemented in Golang.

dog, garden, etc.**
